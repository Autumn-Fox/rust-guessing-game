# Divide and conquer guessing game in Rust

In this game the player is asked to think of a number between 1 and 100, which the program tries to find with the use of yes or no questions.

# Future goals:

- Branch the respository to check if using floats and logic results in the computer finding the player's answer more quickly.
- Ask player to input their answer at the beginning, which the computer can check against.
